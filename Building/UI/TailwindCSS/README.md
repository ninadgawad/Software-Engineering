## Tailwind CSS [Link](https://tailwindcss.com/)
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to help you style your elements directly in your markup. 
Instead of writing custom CSS, you use predefined classes to build your UI components.

### Key Features:
- Utility-First: Offers granular control over design.
- Highly Customizable: Configure design tokens (e.g., colors, spacing) using a config file.
- Modern Workflow: Tailwind's JIT (Just-in-Time) engine compiles only the styles you use, optimizing performance.
- Design Consistency: Forces consistency by reusing utility classes.

### When to Use Tailwind CSS?
- Projects That Need Custom Designs: If your project requires a highly unique and modern design, Tailwind’s flexibility shines.
- Performance-Critical Applications: Tailwind’s JIT engine ensures an optimized CSS bundle.
- Teams with Design Expertise: Ideal for teams that can define and maintain a design system.
