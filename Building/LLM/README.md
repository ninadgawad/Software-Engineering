## Large language model
Based on the search results provided, an LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of machine learning model that is trained on a massive amount of text data to perform a variety of natural language processing tasks. Here are the key points about LLMs:
LLMs are neural networks trained on large datasets of text, often from the internet, to learn patterns and relationships in language. This allows them to generate human-like text, answer questions, and complete other language-related tasks. 
LLMs work by predicting the next word in a sequence based on the previous words, essentially acting as "next-word prediction engines." They assign probabilities to different possible next words. 

Popular examples of LLMs include GPT-3, GPT-4, LaMDA, PaLM, BLOOM, and LLaMA. These models can have billions or even trillions of parameters that allow them to handle a wide range of language tasks. 
LLMs can be used for various applications like chatbots, text generation, code generation, question answering, and more. However, they can also produce "hallucinations" or unreliable outputs if the training data is biased or incomplete. 

The future of LLMs looks promising, with expectations of increased capabilities, audiovisual training, workplace transformation, and improved conversational AI. Cloud providers like AWS also offer services to help developers build applications using LLMs. 

In summary, LLMs are a type of powerful AI language model that can perform a wide variety of natural language tasks by learning patterns from massive text datasets. Their capabilities and applications continue to evolve rapidly.
