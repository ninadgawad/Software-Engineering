## Spring WebClient
Spring WebClient is a non-blocking, reactive HTTP client introduced in Spring 5 as part of the spring-webflux module.
It is designed to replace the older RestTemplate and provides a more modern, reactive approach for performing HTTP requests and handling responses.

### Key Features of Spring WebClient:

**Reactive and Non-Blocking**: WebClient is built on top of Project Reactor, enabling asynchronous and non-blocking HTTP communication.
This makes it suitable for high-performance, reactive applications.

**Fluent API**: It offers a functional, fluent API for building requests and processing responses declaratively.

**Streaming Support**: WebClient supports streaming large response bodies, making it efficient for handling real-time data streams.

**Customizability**: It allows customization of headers, cookies, authentication, and request/response codecs.
Future-Proof: Spring has shifted focus to WebClient for new features, making it the recommended choice over RestTemplate for HTTP operations.
