## Spring Boot
Spring Boot is a popular framework that simplifies the development of backend applications built on the Spring platform. 

### It provides the following key benefits for backend development:
- Rapid Application Development
- Embedded Servers
- Microservices Architecture
- Flexibility and Extensibility
- Production-Ready Features

## Spring Boot API using Spring JPA and WebClient:
- Entity Class: Define the table.
- Repository: JPA repository for CRUD operations.
- Service: Handles the logic of updating request statuses and making WebClient calls.
- Controller: Exposes an API to trigger the request.

## Using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) in Spring Boot with JPA
**What is a DTO?**

A DTO (Data Transfer Object) is an object used to transfer data between layers (e.g., from the repository layer to the service layer or from the service layer to the controller). 
It helps in decoupling the database model (Entity) from the API response.

## Enhancing updateOrderSuccess with Spring JPA Best Practices

**To follow Spring JPA best practices, we’ll implement updateOrderSuccess efficiently by using:**

✅ DTO projections instead of fetching the entire entity.

✅ @Modifying and @Transactional for efficient updates.

✅ Optimized exception handling with @ControllerAdvice.

✅ Logging with @Slf4j for debugging.
