# Software Engineering 
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing, and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles. It involves a disciplined and organized approach to software development with the goal of time and budget efficiency, structured testing, and engineer certification. The field of software engineering covers all aspects of software development, including designing, building, testing, distributing, and maintaining software products. Software engineers apply engineering principles to every stage of the software development lifecycle, from planning and analysis to design, development, testing, integration, quality assurance, and retirement.
