# Hexagonal Architecture

In the ever-evolving world of software development, designing systems that are **robust**, **testable**, and **flexible** is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. 
Enter **Hexagonal Architecture**, also known as the **Ports and Adapters** pattern. 
This powerful architectural style champions the separation of core business logic from external dependencies, leading to software that is easier to maintain, test, and evolve.

## What is Hexagonal Architecture?
Hexagonal Architecture was introduced by Alistair Cockburn with the goal of structuring applications in a way that keeps **business logic at the center**, shielded from changes in user interfaces, databases, or third-party services.
At its core, this pattern organizes software into three primary layers:
* The **Application Core** (Business Logic)
* **Ports** (Interfaces)
* **Adapters** (Implementations)

This layout metaphorically resembles a hexagon (though the shape isn’t strictly enforced), symbolizing the multiple entry and exit points through which external systems communicate with the core.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Isolation

The central principle is to isolate the **domain logic** from technical concerns like frameworks, databases, and UI. This makes the core pure and unaffected by external changes.

### 2. Ports

Ports are **interfaces** that define how external components can interact with the application:

* **Inbound ports** expose operations that the outside world can trigger (e.g., `OrderFoodService`)
* **Outbound ports** define what services the application depends on (e.g., `FoodPaymentService`)

### 3. Adapters

Adapters are the **implementation** of ports. They convert external communication (HTTP requests, database calls, API responses) into internal method calls and vice versa.

Common adapter types include:

* UI Adapters (e.g., Web controllers, CLI handlers)
* Persistence Adapters (e.g., Database access)
* Service Adapters (e.g., External APIs like payment gateways)

## Key Principles

### Separation of Concerns
The architecture decouples domain logic from technical concerns, promoting a clean and modular design.

### Dependency Inversion
Instead of the core logic depending on external services, it depends on **abstractions (ports)**. Infrastructure components implement those abstractions, making it easy to change or swap components.

### Testability
Since the business logic doesn’t rely on external systems, it can be tested independently using simple unit tests.

## Real-World Example: Order Processing System

Let’s say you’re building an order processing system. Here's how Hexagonal Architecture would apply:

### Core Business Logic

Encapsulates functionality like:

* Creating an order
* Validating stock
* Processing a payment

### Ports

* `OrderFoodService`: Inbound port for placing and managing orders
* `FoodPaymentService`: Outbound port for handling payments

### Adapters

* `WebUIAdapter`: Converts HTTP requests into service calls
* `DatabaseAdapter`: Handles data persistence with an SQL database


## Benefits Recap

| Benefit         | Description                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maintainability | Changes to UI, database, or APIs won’t impact the core logic                 |
| Testability     | Write clean unit tests without setting up databases or mocking external APIs |
| Flexibility     | Easily switch infrastructure or UI with minimal impact                       |
| Reusability     | Reuse business logic in new apps or services                                 |

## When Should You Use Hexagonal Architecture?

Consider using Hexagonal Architecture when:

* Your application integrates with multiple external systems
* You want to maximize test coverage of core logic
* Your system is expected to evolve over time (e.g., migrating from monolith to microservices)
* You want to maintain a clean separation between *what* your application does and *how* it does it


**Note:**
Hexagonal Architecture empowers teams to build resilient, modular, and adaptable software. 
By placing the business logic at the heart of your application and protecting it from external volatility, you create systems that are easier to maintain, test, and grow.
