## 1. Technical Architecture

**Patterns:** microservices, monolith, event-driven, serverless
**Trade-offs:** consistency vs availability, latency vs throughput
**Integration:** APIs, event buses, messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
**Scalability & Performance:** horizontal scaling, caching (Redis), load balancing

## 2. Software Delivery
- CI/CD, DevOps, GitOps
- Sprint planning, velocity tracking, delivery metrics
- Risk management and go-live readiness

## 3. Team Leadership
- Coaching/Mentoring
- Conflict resolution
- Hiring and onboarding
- Career development frameworks

## 4. Governance & Quality
- Architecture reviews
- Code reviews / tech debt logs
- Security and compliance (SOC2, GDPR, OWASP Top 10)

## 5. Stakeholder Communication
- Translate tech for non-tech stakeholders
- Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Communicate risks and trade-offs clearly

## 6. Business & Product Alignment
- Understand business KPIs
- Prioritize technical work based on impact
- Build reusable platforms / reduce duplicated efforts
