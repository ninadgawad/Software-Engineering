## Micro Frontends: Modular Frontend Development
Micro frontends extend the microservices philosophy to the client side, breaking monolithic frontends into smaller, autonomous modules. 
Each module—developed, tested, and deployed independently—enables teams to work concurrently on different application parts without interdependencies.

### Core Principles:
**Technology Agnosticism:** Teams can use frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js without coordination.
**Isolation:** Modules operate independently, avoiding shared state or runtime conflicts.
**Native Browser Features:** Communication via browser events instead of custom APIs reduces complexity.

### Benefits:
**Scalability:** Large applications like e-commerce platforms can delegate product listings, carts, and user profiles to separate teams.

**Faster Iterations:** Independent deployments reduce bottlenecks, accelerating feature releases.

**Flexibility:** Legacy systems can integrate modern components incrementally.

**Team autonomy:** Decentralized teams choose tools aligned with their domain, fostering innovation.


## Challenges and Considerations:
- **Coordination complexity:** Ensuring design consistency across teams requires robust governance.
- **Performance overhead:** Multiple bundles may increase load times without careful optimization.
- **Over-engineering risk:** Critics argue micro frontends add unnecessary complexity for smaller applications.



Example: A retail site might use micro frontends for search (React), checkout (Vue), and recommendations (Angular), all seamlessly combined.
